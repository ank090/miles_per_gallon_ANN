# miles_per_gallon_ANN  
## Context
The data is technical spec of cars. The dataset is downloaded from UCI Machine Learning Repository  
  
This dataset is a slightly modified version of the dataset provided in
the StatLib library. In line with the use by Ross Quinlan (1993) in
predicting the attribute "mpg", 8 of the original instances were removed
because they had unknown values for the "mpg" attribute. The original
dataset is available in the file "auto-mpg.data-original".

"The data concerns city-cycle fuel consumption in miles per gallon,
to be predicted in terms of 3 multivalued discrete and 5 continuous
attributes." (Quinlan, 1993)

Number of Instances: 398

Number of Attributes: 9 including the class attribute

## Attribute Information:

mpg: continuous  
cylinders: multi-valued discrete  
displacement: continuous  
horsepower: continuous  
weight: continuous  
acceleration: continuous  
model year: multi-valued discrete  
origin: multi-valued discrete  
car name: string (unique for each instance)  
Missing Attribute Values: horsepower has 6 missing values
